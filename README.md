The exceptionally unexceptional plant humidifier

For this to work you need to:
1. Go into courrier_bot.py and make sure your pins match the numbers in there (use https://pinout.xyz and ./blueprints/reference.png as reference).
2. Create a token.txt file for your bot token.
3. Create a logging file called "watering.log".
4. Create a service for the bot (courrier_bot.py).

You can now test out things n' stuff.
